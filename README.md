# Diary training log

Keep track of your daily aerobic trainings in this simple log.

## Installation

You will need `node.js` to run the test server and to install all the
dependencies of the project. The installation of `node.js` is beyond the scope
of this guide, if you don't have node installed, follow the [joyent
guide][node-install].

To verify if `node.js` is running, run the command:

```bash
$ node --version
```

If everything is ok, you should see something like:

```bash
v.0.10.3
```

To install the project dependencies, run the command:

```bash
$ npm install
```

To verify the installed packages, run the commands:

```bash
$ npm ls
$ bower ls
```

## Usage

You can start the test server using the command:

```bash
$ npm start
```

The server can be stopped by hitting `CTRL`+`C`.

### Components

The application is composed by several components. Those components comunicate
with each other via emit/listen events (as imposed by [flight][flight]).

#### `LogData`

Component responsible for the log manipulations, has methods responsibles for
create, remove and load log entries.

Emit the events:

1. `dataLogCreated` with an object containing the key `html` with the log entry
   rendered as html,
2. `dataLogUpdated` with an object containing the keys `_id` that represents
   the originalId and the `html` rendered entry.
3. `dataLogRemoved` with an object containing the key `_id` of the deleted
   entry.
4. `dataLogRefreshed` with an object containing the key `html` and all the log
   entries rendered as html.
5. `dataLogLoaded` with the loaded entry.

Listen to:

1. `uiCreateLogRequested` react emitting a `dataLogCreated`
2. `uiUpdateLogRequested` react emitting a `dataLogUpdated`
3. `uiRemoveLogRequested` react emitting a `dataLogRemoved`
4. `uiLoadLogRequested` react emitting a `dataLogLoaded`
5. `uiRefreshLogRequested` react emitting a `dataLogRefreshed`
6. `dataRefreshLogRequested` react emitting a `dataLogRefreshed`

#### `ReportData`

Component responsible for generate resumed information for the log entries.

Emit the events:

1. `dataReportCreated` with the statistical info for all the trainings.

Liste to:

1. `dataLogCreated` react emitting a `dataReportCreated`
2. `dataLogUpdated` react emitting a `dataReportCreated`
3. `dataLogRemoved` react emitting a `dataReportCreated`
4. `dataLogRefreshed` react emitting a `dataReportCreated`

#### `EntryUI`

Component responsible for controlling the form that allow the creation of a new
log entry.

Emit the events:

1. `uiCreateLogRequested` with an object containing the log data
2. `uiUpdateLogRequested` with an object containing the log data
3. `uiActivateTabRequested` with an object containing the key `key` and the tab
   to be changed.

Listen to:

1. `submit` of the form, react emitting a `uiActivateTabRequested` and
   `uiCreateLogRequested`
2. `dataLogLoaded` loads the passed data into a form for edition.

#### `EntryControlUI`

Component responsible for controlling the actions of a given log entry.

Emit the events:

1. `uiRemoveLogRequested` with the `\_id` of the entry to be removed.
2. `uiLoadLogRequested` with the `\_id` of the entry to be loaded.

Listen to:

1. `click` in the buttons emitting the events shown above.

#### `TableUI`

Component responsible for controlling the log entries presentation.

Emit the events:

1. `uiRefreshLogRequested` during the initialization process this event is sent
to load the content.

Listen to:

1. `dataLogRefreshed` refresh the node content with the passed info
2. `dataLogCreated` render the created entry
3. `dataLogUpdated` replace a node with the updated entry
4. `dataLogRemoved`remove a given node

#### `TabUI`

Component responsible for controlling the state of tab widgets.

Emit the events:

1. `uiTabChanged` with an object with the keys `button` and `content` containing
the id's of the activated nodes.

Listen to:

1. `click` on a button, react emitting a `uiTabChanged`
2. `uiActivateTabRequested` react emitting a `uiTabChanged`
